        <title>Youre Not Getting Any Younger - Multigen Living Can Save Your Money and Health</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RCPnMyj1Zik?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, I’ve been seeing a trend where buyers look for homes that will accommodate multiple generations—grandparents, parents, kids, and grandkids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My gut tells me that there is a demographic shift occurring here,&lt;/strong&gt; where:
  1. Grandparents or empty-nesters are becoming more inclined to live with people of other generations, and/or:
  2. Younger generations are more inclined to have their parents or grandparents living with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re all living longer, the older generations might feel the pressure of housing costs. Secondly, as people try to downsize in today’s marketplace, it’s important to know that buying a smaller home doesn’t always mean that the costs are lower. &lt;strong&gt;Typically people are looking for different floor plans, possibly those with main-level living, and those properties can be more costly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely for the younger generation, having the parents or grandparents around could be helpful in regards to caring for children. I also think &lt;strong&gt;that this younger generation might worry for their parents as they slow down with age;&lt;/strong&gt; as they lose mobility and develop medical issues, they need more attention, and their younger counterparts want to be there to ensure they’re safe and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=SINCE WE’RE ALL LIVING LONGER, THE OLDER GENERATIONS MIGHT FEEL THE PRESSURE ON HOUSING COSTS.%20localhost:4000/selling-home-get-free-home-value-report.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“SINCE WE’RE ALL LIVING LONGER, THE OLDER GENERATIONS MIGHT FEEL THE PRESSURE ON HOUSING COSTS.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting these factors together, many people have asked about what opportunities there are where they can bring the whole family together. Some &lt;strong&gt;big builders are starting to build what they call multigenerational plans in which they’ve accommodated into the floor plan a space where the parents and grandparents can have their own space,&lt;/strong&gt; alongside the general or main living areas with the rest of the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to accommodate multiple generations, they might move, eliminate, or add some walls. They might make the basement a fully furnished space (with a kitchen and bathroom) with a separate entrance from the main door to foster privacy for the occupants. Additionally, if the property is large enough, then a guest house could be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about accommodating multigenerational living, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help and advise you however I can.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Keep Radon Out of Your Home and Keep Your Family Safe</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KjUUKf0Jkks?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m joined by Randy Paquette of First Choice Radon to discuss what you can do to prevent radon from seeping into your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a gas, radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. among non-smokers. It also kills more people annually than breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, radon is easy to test for, and you can do it with several different monitors. &lt;strong&gt;Randy suggests that you test for radon annually, even if you have a radon system already installed in your house.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t have access to professional radon testing, you can use a home kit. Home kits take about 48 hours. After the test is done, you send the kit to a lab, which then sends you back your results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your numbers come back a little high, you should have a professional then test your home so you know exactly what the levels are. Once you know what the levels are, the next step is to mitigate them. If you have a basement or a slab home, they create a vacuum under your home using a sub-slab system (or “fan system” as some call it), which sucks the radon out before it can get inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=IN THE LONG RUN, THE COST OF PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY FROM RADON IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT.%20localhost:4000/keep-radon-out-of-your-home-and-keep.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“IN THE LONG RUN, THE COST OF PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY FROM RADON IS WORTH THE INVESTMENT.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a crawl space home, this process takes a little more work, so the cost is a little different. &lt;strong&gt;Basement and slab-home mitigations cost about $1,300,&lt;/strong&gt; but the system itself should last anywhere between 10 to 30 years, so the annual cost is negligible. It only costs about $2 per month to operate the system, which is also a negligible amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single test costs roughly $150.&lt;/strong&gt; North Carolina is what’s referred to as a “red state,” meaning homes here typically have higher levels of radon in them, so $150 is a sensible investment to protect your family from something as potentially dangerous as radon is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about radon or radon testing or you have any other real estate needs I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Buyers and Sellers Must Know About Our Spring Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U54qKO2oGT4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The month of March has been cold and dreary here in the Raleigh area. So, when I say that it’s time to get ready for the spring market, many people think, “Spring market? It’s still winter!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the cold, spring has definitely arrived. The spring real estate market has sprung. &lt;strong&gt;I recently looked at all homes listed on our MLS in the last 30 days, and I found that 62% of those properties are already under contract.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells us that the market is at a blistering pace. So, today I’d like to bring you some tips on how to prepare if you plan to buy or sell in our spring or summer market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by talking about buyers. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re thinking of making a home purchase this year, I recommend that you do so sooner rather than later.&lt;/strong&gt; Interest rates are sliding up a little bit and many predict this trend will continue into the future. So, make your move as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to take as a buyer is to get with a good lender and get pre-approved. This will give you a good starting place for your home search. Once you’ve met with a trusted local lender, you’ll need to find a good agent. The right agent will not only be able to help you strategize your home search, but they will also be able to help you find properties that haven’t come to the market yet. Additionally, a good agent will help you make faster decisions, which will be beneficial in our fast-paced market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=LISTINGS ARE MOVING QUICKLY, BUT MORE INVENTORY WILL BE COMING TO OUR MARKET SOON.%20localhost:4000/what-buyers-and-sellers-must-know-about.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“LISTINGS ARE MOVING QUICKLY, BUT MORE INVENTORY WILL BE COMING TO OUR MARKET SOON.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for sellers, you may want to wait until the summer to make your move.&lt;/strong&gt; This is especially the case if you have children since they will be out of school during this time and more family-style homes tend to be listed at this time of year. That said, now is the best time to focus on getting your home ready for the market. That way when it comes time to list, you will be well-prepared. Listings are moving quickly, but more inventory will be coming to our market soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You Never Know What Issues a Home Might Have</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XQSegsE9As?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about home inspections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond a general home inspection, there are several specific inspections buyers may choose to conduct while under contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radon inspections, termite inspections, and others are all options, depending on the features of the property and the buyer’s concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, during a general inspection, the home inspector finds fault with any of the features they examine, additional inspections may be ordered to further evaluate the specific issue. When specific issues are uncovered, it can be beneficial to have a specialized expert take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the case of new construction homes, the issues an inspection can uncover will more than justify the cost of the process. &lt;strong&gt;A home inspection usually costs around $500, with additional inspections costing between $100 and $150.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some buyers wonder why they can’t just inspect the home on their own. Technically this is an option, but if the buyer plans to use the inspection report to pursue negotiations with the seller, a licensed inspector is best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WHEN SPECIFIC ISSUES ARE UNCOVERED, IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO HAVE A SPECIALIZED EXPERT TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.%20localhost:4000/you-never-know-what-issues-home-might.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WHEN SPECIFIC ISSUES ARE UNCOVERED, IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO HAVE A SPECIALIZED EXPERT TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t only buyers who can order a home inspection. Many sellers have asked me recently if they should order one before listing their property. This isn’t always advisable, but if a home is more than 10 years old, there are absolutely some advantages to doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a seller orders an inspection before listing, they can get issues addressed ahead of time.&lt;/strong&gt; It also gives them more leverage in terms of marketing the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few key points on what you need to know about home inspections. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Ways to Make Your 2018 Move as Smooth as Possible </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTLEZMtxZOc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking about buying a house in the 2018 spring market, there are a number of things you can do to put yourself in a strong position when getting ready to make your move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few pointers on how to get ahead of things if you plan on making a move in the coming year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Check your credit score.&lt;/strong&gt; Most people think that they’re in good shape, but the fact is that there are some derogatories that can find their way onto your report. Those problems can take time to clean up, so make sure that you look at that ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Start looking at homes and neighborhoods.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider things that the home will deliver for you. If you have a growing family, you may need more space. If you are downsizing, you may need a master bedroom on the main level. Start looking around and make a preliminary checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep tabs on interest rates.&lt;/strong&gt; Shop for a lender, too. You need to get pre-approved, and it’s better to do that sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. If you own your home, you need to put a plan together to get maximum value from your home sale.&lt;/strong&gt; This includes things like staging, repairs, or making some upgrades to make your home more attractive to potential buyers. Get an idea of what you can net from the sale and put that into the financing for your next home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=GET APPROVED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.%20localhost:4000/5-ways-to-make-your-2018-move-as-smooth.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“GET APPROVED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to get the equity out of your current home first and move into temporary housing while you shop for your next home? Or do you want to go for a same-day closing on both properties? Each of these strategies has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, so let me know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Interview potential real estate brokers.&lt;/strong&gt; Find one who can provide the best service and help you find a home or get the maximum value for your current home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Have You Set Any Goals for the New Year?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yZuimBS6WMc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals—now that we’re in the new year, what are your goals? Do you have them written down? Are you reviewing them on a regular basis? If not, here are some things that you may want to consider that may help you set, stick to, and achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most anything you read about goal-setting states that if you write your goals down, you’re 80% more likely to achieve them. For years, I had goals that I kept in my head but never wrote down. I don’t think I was nearly as effective in achieving them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some authors on goal-setting even suggest that it’s a good idea to review your goals daily,&lt;/strong&gt; first thing in the morning when you wake up and as the last thing you do before you go to bed at night. That may seem excessive for some, but the whole point to that conversation is to make sure that once you get your goals written down, you don’t let 12 months pass before you review them again. You should choose whatever is going to be a good process for you to be checking on your own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d like to share a tool I use which I’ve found helpful in terms of setting a goal,&lt;/strong&gt; as well as placing underpinnings beneath that goal that will help you review your progress and overall process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=IF YOU WRITE YOUR GOALS DOWN, YOU’RE 80% MORE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THEM.%20localhost:4000/have-you-set-any-goals-for-new-year.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“IF YOU WRITE YOUR GOALS DOWN, YOU’RE 80% MORE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THEM.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose my goal is to lose 10 pounds. This time of year, it’s always especially difficult with the number of holiday dinners that we’re exposed to. To help with that goal, &lt;strong&gt;I’ve drafted a “1-3-5” form.&lt;/strong&gt; To make one for yourself, you should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Write one goal at the top of the form.&lt;br /&gt;
  • Devise three strategies that will help you achieve those goals. Write them laterally beneath your goal.&lt;br /&gt;
  • For each strategy, come up with five different tactics that you can measure and develop to meet your goal. Write those in the columns beneath each strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For losing 10 pounds, my three strategies are to generally improve my diet, lift weights and work out three days a week, and to do cardio exercises two days of the week. To illustrate the purpose of the 1-3-5 form, I’ve created five tactics for eating better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taking a protein shake once a day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting soda from my diet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cutting fast food from my diet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No dessert.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop eating past 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, I’m able to develop not only a goal, but put some underpinnings on it as well. &lt;strong&gt;I can check this form on a daily basis to hold myself accountable for achieving my goal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about goal-setting, please reach out to me. I’d love to hear some of your goals and strategies for achieving them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What the Ismay Realty Group Is Thankful for This Year</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ajtgdh_sOmE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we approach the end of the year and prepare for 2018, it’s a good time to reflect on the blessings we’ve seen in 2017. I recently learned that when you write down the things you’re grateful for, a chemical reaction occurs in your brain which leads to feelings of joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a proven fact, so why not give it a try? &lt;strong&gt;If you’d like to let me know what you are grateful for this year, get in touch. I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at the Ismay Realty Group, we’re grateful for a few things. First of all, we’re grateful for our office manager, Robyn. Robyn has been with us a long time, and despite some medical hardships this year, she has been recovering well. She’s still receiving some treatments, but is getting stronger all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=WE’RE SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOU.%20localhost:4000/what-ismay-realty-group-is-thankful-for.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“WE’RE SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOU.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we’re grateful for is all of you: our clients. &lt;strong&gt;We appreciate everyone who has trusted their transaction to us over this past year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don't Let This Ruin Your Home Sale</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FCp8ziAMhQM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are preparing your home for the market, you need to check on your crawl space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may say, “Why would I even want to think about the crawl space? I don’t want to go look at it. There are spiders down there!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely understand where you are coming from. Like the saying goes: Out of sight, out of mind. However, we’ve had several clients experience delays and costly surprises during their transactions thanks to their crawl space. These issues could have been avoided with some preparation up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at your crawl space, there are a few things to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=AVOID COSTLY REPAIRS AND DELAYS BY CHECKING OUT THE CRAWL SPACE UP FRONT.%20localhost:4000/check-your-crawl-space-before-you-put.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“AVOID COSTLY REPAIRS AND DELAYS BY CHECKING OUT THE CRAWL SPACE UP FRONT.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The insulation is hanging down.&lt;/strong&gt; If you see this, that could mean that moisture levels have risen above the acceptable level. If that’s the case, you should also look for small leaks in any pipes and get those taken care of. Check for water around the foundation as well. It could be that your gutters are clogged, that your downspouts aren’t draining properly, or that you need extensions for your downspouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Is your vapor barrier in good condition?&lt;/strong&gt; The vapor barrier should not be torn. Make sure that it is spread out evenly and that it covers the majority of the dirt floor in the crawl space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Termite bond.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a company that checks your property, they will do moisture readings in the crawl space. A lack of moisture helps prevent termites. If you don’t have a termite bond, it might be worth your while to get a termite inspection before you put your home on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few things you can do to avoid any delays or costly repairs once you get your home on the market and under contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about crawl space maintenance or preparing your home for the market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 Reasons to Consider Selling During the Holiday Season</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PqwElhSe-vc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although spring is traditionally considered the best time to sell a home, today I’m excited to share the top 10 reasons you should consider listing in the next few months before the spring market hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. You will have the opportunity to be a non-contingent buyer in the spring.&lt;/strong&gt; In the spring, there are more homes available on the market. By listing now, you can sell high and buy low in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. You can restrict showings during the holidays.&lt;/strong&gt; They don’t have to upset your family time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. January is when employees start new jobs.&lt;/strong&gt; Since transfer employees can’t wait until spring to buy, you’ll need to be on the market at the end of the year to capture those buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. People are looking to buy for tax reasons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. People have more time to look for homes.&lt;/strong&gt; Because people often take off work during the holidays, they will be freer to spend time searching the market than other times of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=LESS COMPETITION ON THE MARKET MEANS MORE EYES ON YOUR PROPERTY.%20localhost:4000/10-reasons-to-consider-selling-during.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“LESS COMPETITION ON THE MARKET MEANS MORE EYES ON YOUR PROPERTY.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Buyers are more emotional.&lt;/strong&gt; During the holidays, people become sentimental and may be more likely to pay a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Houses show better when they are decorated for the holidays.&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone loves seasonal decor, so homes at this time of year are more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Supply will dramatically increase as the spring market ramps up in January.&lt;/strong&gt; This will lead to less demand, and less demand means less money in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Serious buyers have fewer options.&lt;/strong&gt; During fall and winter months, there is less competition on the market. This puts your listing at an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. People who look for homes at this time of year are much more serious about buying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information about selling your home this time of year, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Out-of-Pocket Costs Homebuyers Should Expect </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r75x3Kucyqc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buying a home, there are four out-of-pocket expenses that you should be prepared to pay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Selling a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a free home value report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Buying a home? &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Your due diligence deposit.&lt;/strong&gt; Our purchase contract was revised a few years ago and now stipulates that the buyer make a non-refundable due diligence deposit to the seller. This deposit does credit back to the transaction as long as you make it to the closing table. The due diligence deposits can range anywhere from $500 to several thousand dollars, depending on the price of the property and the competitive pressure against the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The earnest money deposit.&lt;/strong&gt; This is another deposit from the buyer to the seller, in addition to the due diligence deposit. Like the due diligence deposit, the earnest money deposit credits back to the transaction at closing. The earnest money deposit can range from $1,000 to several thousand dollars, again depending on the price of the property and the amount of pressure on the property at the time of contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Home inspections.&lt;/strong&gt; A general inspection, termite inspection, and radon inspection are the big three that you’ll want to order. Home inspections range from $700 to $800 overall. That said, there may be additional inspections required based on what the initial inspections find. If the property has a well or septic tank, those require their own inspections. Generally, though, expect to pay $700 to $800. Those expenses can be moved to the settlement statement, but it’s good to know that amount up front for planning purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Other fees and service costs.&lt;/strong&gt; Depending on your lender, you will have to pay some costs for the appraisal process, application fee, and more. These other services usually cost a few hundred dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=THE EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT CREDITS BACK TO THE TRANSACTION AT CLOSING.%20localhost:4000/4-out-of-pocket-costs-homebuyers-should.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“THE EARNEST MONEY DEPOSIT CREDITS BACK TO THE TRANSACTION AT CLOSING.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the four main costs that you should plan for when buying a home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about the home buying process or our current real estate market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
