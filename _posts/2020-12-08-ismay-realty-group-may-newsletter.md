Welcome May\!

We hope this newsletter finds you and your loved ones doing well as we all continue to navigate through this pandemic.

We are still in the middle of this world reset but hoping we will come to the end of it soon.&nbsp; We would love to hear about ways you and your family are coping with this. We have heard of people being very creative in how they are spending their time. There is always good that comes from something that seems so bad. We continue to look for the good.

In this month’s newsletter, we are giving you a few ways to determine your strategy if you are thinking about if this (or the coming months) is the right time to sell, buy or maybe refinance.

Please know that when things return to “normal” we will be still be here\! If in the meantime, you have questions regarding selling your home, looking for a property in the Raleigh area or looking for investment property, we are happy to guide you (or friends/family)\!

The Ismay Realty Group would like to give a huge shout out to all the essential workers that are working to keep us all safe while putting their own lives in danger. Thank you\!

Please be safe and healthy\! Stay home as much as possible. We will all get through this together\!

All the Best,Greg
