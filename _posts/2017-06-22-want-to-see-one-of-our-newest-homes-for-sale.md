Today I have a property I want to show you that we’re bringing on the market this Saturday. It’s a custom-built, ranch-style home located in a neighborhood on the west side of US 1 in Wake Forest. We’re pricing this home to sell, so there will be a lot of demand for it. We’ll be running open houses on both Saturday and Sunday, and our goal is to have it sold by the time the owner gets back from their vacation on Monday. To learn more about this property and get a guided tour of the outside, watch my latest video.
