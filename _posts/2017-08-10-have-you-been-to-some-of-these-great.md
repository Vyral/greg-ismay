Are you looking for something fun and different to do here in Raleigh? I have a list of great venues and activities for you today.

There are a lot of great things to do in our area, so if you get an itch to go out, here are a few different places for you to check out:

**First, make sure to visit the <a href="http://boothamphitheatre.com/" target="_blank">Koka Booth Ampitheatre</a>** for weekly movies on the lawn and weekly concerts, which include country music, bluegrass, and rock and roll. They even host the North Carolina symphony on occasion.

The art museum also features weekly movies on the lawn and concerts.

Speaking of music, **<a href="http://visitnorthhills.com/" target="_blank">North Hills</a>** has its annual summer beach series going on right now; you can check that out each Thursday night. In the fall, they will switch over to their tribute band series on Friday nights.

**If you are looking for some major acts, look no further than the <a href="http://walnutcreekamphitheatre.com/" target="_blank">Walnut Creek Amphitheatre.</a>** Upcoming concerts include Foreigner, John Mayer, Luke Bryan, Green Day, and more.

If you’ve been waiting for a reason to check out downtown Raleigh, don’t miss **<a href="http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/restaurant-week" target="_blank">Raleigh Restaurant Week</a>** from August 21st through the 27th. This is a great time to explore the downtown area and enjoy some great food.

We also have some great professional sports. From the Durham Bulls to the Carolina Mudcats, there is still plenty of baseball to see this year. Soon, hockey players will be ready to take the ice.

North Carolina is a college sports mecca, with Duke and North Carolina football teams getting ready to take the field. After that comes basketball. So, all throughout the year, we have some real quality sports teams to watch.

When it comes to art, culture, and museums, there are a lot of great venues to consider:<br>

  • The UNC Arboretum<br>
  • The UNC Playmakers Repertory Theatre Company<br>
  • The Duke Art Museum<br>
  • The North Carolina Museum of Art<br>
  • The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science in Durham<br>
  • The North Carolina History Museum<br>
  • The Carolina Ballet<br>
  • The North Carolina State Assembly Legislature<br>
  • The Governor's Mansion<br>
  • That is just a brief rundown of some very interesting venues and great places to go for inexpensive entertainment here in the area.<br>
