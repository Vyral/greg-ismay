Hello August\! Hard to believe we are more than half way through the year\! 2020 has certainly not been what we were expecting in January\!

We hope you and your loved ones are doing well and continuing to stay safe during these times\! We all continue to handle things in the best way we can.

As I write this newsletter in the middle of July, we are still in Phase 2, at this point&nbsp; it seems until at least August 7th. We hope we continue moving towards more things opening and at the same time keeping everyone safe.

In this newsletter we try to provide you valuable information and keep you up-to-date with what is happening in and around Raleigh, from the housing market to fun things to do for you and your family.

We would love to hear from you\! Please share how you and your family are doing\!

The Ismay Realty Group continues to appreciate all those working on our behalf and please stay safe and healthy\! We will all continue to get through this together\!
