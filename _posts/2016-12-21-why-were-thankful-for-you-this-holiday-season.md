Today I wanted reach out briefly just to give you thanks for helping us make 2016 such a great year. These are the top five things we're grateful for from 2016:

1. All our great clients we had the privilege of representing this year. We thank you for your business!
2. Robyn's health. A year ago, Robyn wasn't healthy, so we thank the surgeons, doctors, nurses, and staff at Wake Forest Medical Center who brought her back to her awesome self.
3. Our vendors and contractors that we refer. When clients and friends have issues, we refer these folks in good faith. They always deliver!
4. Our families and friends. This one goes without saying!
5. Looking forward to next year. We can't wait for 2017 and the great year we're planning.

I hope you and your loves ones have a happy holiday season. We look forward to seeing you next year!
