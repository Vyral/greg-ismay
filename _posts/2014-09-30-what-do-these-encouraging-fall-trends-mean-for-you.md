Recently, we've seen a great deal of activity here in the Triangle real estate market. While there is typically a lull in activity during the fall months, we are seeing many new construction starts. In fact, inventory is up 4% over July of last year, which is mostly due to the new construction in the area. With resale listings falling a bit, there are plenty of great opportunities out there for both buyers and sellers.
