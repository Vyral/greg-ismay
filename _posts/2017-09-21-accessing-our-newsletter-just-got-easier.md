I was just talking recently with a past client, Lori, who had a great idea. As you may know, we do have a newsletter available.

<div class="post-cta">
Selling a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Get a free home value report</a><br>
Buying a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>
</div>

{% include pullquote.html %}

**This newsletter contains information on the market, vendors, local happenings, and success stories as well.**

This brings me to Lori’s great idea. It all started when she realized she’d gone to work without bringing along our newsletter.

**For this reason, she suggested that we find a way to put copies of our newsletter up on our blog.**

So, my team and I made it happen. Now we have archives of our past and current newsletters on the blog.

For those of you who don’t receive our newsletter, please let me know and I’ll get you on the list.

If you have any great ideas like this one or a question you’d like to see in our video, we’d love to hear it.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
