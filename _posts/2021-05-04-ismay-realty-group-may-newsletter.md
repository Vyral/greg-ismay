U.S. housing starts rebounded sharply in March to the highest levels since 2006, exceeding forecasts and indicating residential construction is getting back on track after winter storm-related setbacks.

Residential starts jumped 19.4% last month to a 1.74 million annualized rate, according to government data. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1.61 million pace. Applications to build also climbed.
