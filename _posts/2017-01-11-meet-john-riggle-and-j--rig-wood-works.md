We are going to talk about something a little different than real estate, today. This is the first in a series of videos where we are featuring some of the fine folks we do business with. First up is John Riggle and J. Rig Wood Works.

John started his business as a hobby. He had some woodworking supplies in his garage, but one day his wife wanted him to redo some countertops. To make a long story short, some of the wood that he used for those countertops turned into a nice cutting board for his wife. After some neighbors saw it, he was making cutting boards for them too. **Soon word started to spread about John and his woodshop, and the rest is history.**

Most of what John does is butcher block style cutting boards. He buys rough lumber, cuts it into workable pieces, and glues them together in different patterns. After that, he lets it sit in a machine that glues the wood together for a full day, then it’s time to sand and finish the boards. He’s been able to get more and more great woodworking equipment over the years and always does a fantastic job.

**Although cutting boards are his specialty, John has the ability to make a wide variety of wood products.** He even has a special engraver that is perfect for putting company logos, sports teams, or personal messages on.

Thanks to John for joining us today. If you have any questions for him or if you’re looking to get some custom woodworking done, give him a call at (919)-435-8931 or visit his website here.
