I’m delighted to be joined today by Kevin Taylor of Taylor 1 Flooring to talk a little bit about how he’s helping some of our clients with their flooring needs. **We also wanted to show off his handiwork.**

Kevin has been in the flooring business for 27 years and his company services all areas of Raleigh. There are three projects in particular that he has done for us recently that really stand out.

The first is with a home that had carpet and old laminate wood throughout. He ended up tearing up the whole floor and replacing the carpet with a nice, hand-scraped oak wood that significantly improved the value of the home.

Next, we had a carpeted living room that the owner wanted to match to the wood in the kitchen and the entryway. Kevin was able to find a wood that was very close to the color and quality of the rest of the floor for a lower price.

Finally, a leaky bathroom meant Kevin had to tear up a shower and find the source of the leak. He did, sealed it, then installed a brand-new shower and bathtub.

**These are just a few of the times where Kevin has really been able to help our clients out.** If you have any questions for us about Taylor 1 Flooring or anything else, give us a call or send us an email and we’d be happy to answer it for you or refer you to someone who can.
