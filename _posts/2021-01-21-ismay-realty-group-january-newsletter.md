Welcome January 2021\!\! We made it\! We’ve moved out of 2020\! Spring is on it’s way\!&nbsp;

A new survey ranks Raleigh-Durham No. 1 and Charlotte No. 11 for expected growth in housing construction in 2021 among the nation's 80 largest markets. Experts say it's being driven by continued migration to the state. The findings come from the 2021 "Emerging Trends in Real Estate" report. It's based on a survey of developers, investors and other real estate professionals and other data.

Home prices, relatively speaking, are lower in North Carolina than in big Northern and Western cities. Prices and telecommuting amid the coronavirus pandemic will spur continued migration. It’s a great time to find new real estate in North Carolina\!

If you or family/friends are looking to explore what Raleigh and the surrounding areas have to offer, please reach out. We are here to answer questions and keep you informed of what is happening in the area.
