If you are thinking about buying a house in the 2018 spring market, there are a number of things you can do to put yourself in a strong position when getting ready to make your move.

Selling a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Get a free home value report</a><br>
Buying a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>
</div>

Here are a few pointers on how to get ahead of things if you plan on making a move in the coming year:

**1. Check your credit score.** Most people think that they’re in good shape, but the fact is that there are some derogatories that can find their way onto your report. Those problems can take time to clean up, so make sure that you look at that ahead of time.

**2. Start looking at homes and neighborhoods.** Consider things that the home will deliver for you. If you have a growing family, you may need more space. If you are downsizing, you may need a master bedroom on the main level. Start looking around and make a preliminary checklist.

**3. Keep tabs on interest rates.** Shop for a lender, too. You need to get pre-approved, and it’s better to do that sooner rather than later.

**4. If you own your home, you need to put a plan together to get maximum value from your home sale.** This includes things like staging, repairs, or making some upgrades to make your home more attractive to potential buyers. Get an idea of what you can net from the sale and put that into the financing for your next home.

Do you want to get the equity out of your current home first and move into temporary housing while you shop for your next home? Or do you want to go for a same-day closing on both properties? Each of these strategies has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, so let me know if you have any questions.

**5. Interview potential real estate brokers.** Find one who can provide the best service and help you find a home or get the maximum value for your current home.

As always, if you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you.
