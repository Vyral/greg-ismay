In Part 3 of our home selling pricing strategy series, we're discussing our team's strategy for finding a price for your home and how it digs deeper than the comparative market analyses most agents perform. While most agents will go on the MLS and pull a few comparable properties to find a price for your home, we prepare a much more comprehensive document that includes technical analysis and a wealth of information about how the house compares to similar houses in the area. We've found that this document yields higher offers from potential buyers because of how in-depth it is. For more details on our pricing strategy, watch this short video.&nbsp;
