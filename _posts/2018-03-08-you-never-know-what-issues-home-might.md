Let’s talk about home inspections.

Beyond a general home inspection, there are several specific inspections buyers may choose to conduct while under contract.

**Radon inspections, termite inspections, and others are all options, depending on the features of the property and the buyer’s concerns.**

If, during a general inspection, the home inspector finds fault with any of the features they examine, additional inspections may be ordered to further evaluate the specific issue. When specific issues are uncovered, it can be beneficial to have a specialized expert take a closer look.

Even in the case of new construction homes, the issues an inspection can uncover will more than justify the cost of the process. **A home inspection usually costs around $500, with additional inspections costing between $100 and $150.**

Some buyers wonder why they can’t just inspect the home on their own. Technically this is an option, but if the buyer plans to use the inspection report to pursue negotiations with the seller, a licensed inspector is best.

It isn’t only buyers who can order a home inspection. Many sellers have asked me recently if they should order one before listing their property. This isn’t always advisable, but if a home is more than 10 years old, there are absolutely some advantages to doing so.

**When a seller orders an inspection before listing, they can get issues addressed ahead of time.** It also gives them more leverage in terms of marketing the home.

These are just a few key points on what you need to know about home inspections. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
