Friends and clients—

Spring is in the air, and the floodgates have already opened on the traditionally busy selling season.&nbsp;

The fiercer seller’s market that emerged in the wake of last spring’s pandemic shock is still with us as 2021 begins to thaw and bloom.&nbsp;

However, with more inventory expected to hit the market soon, buyers may find a smidgen of relief. If you’re considering a home purchase or a refinance, here’s what you need to know:&nbsp;

**Rates are still relatively low, but not for lack of upward pressure...&nbsp;**

Catastrophic power outages in the Lone Star state and an increase in rates for 30-year fixed mortgages created downward pressure on demand.&nbsp;

Last month, total mortgage application volume fell by 11.4%, while refinance applications in Texas—home to one of the hottest housing markets in the country—plummeted by 40%.&nbsp;

Freddie Mac reported that the benchmark for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage had ratcheted up to 2.97%—still historically low. (For context: Last year at this time, Freddie Mac’s benchmark stood at 3.45%).&nbsp;

The Fed is still keeping rates artificially low by buying up billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities.

However, with rate increases in six of the last eight weeks, it’s clear that we’ve shifted into a rising rate environment.

&nbsp;“I don’t foresee mortgage rates jumping to an alarming level, but we should prepare for a rise of at least a decimal point or two,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.

&nbsp;So, fears of a massive month-over-month rate jump on par with what we saw in June 2013 may not be warranted.&nbsp;

However, with increasingly positive economic outlooks amid vaccine rollouts and expectations for higher budget deficits, the Fed’s focus may soon turn to curbing inflationary pressures.&nbsp;

**Prices keep cranking up.&nbsp;**

At the end of February, it was reported that home prices had been increasing at the fastest pace since 2014. I

n at least 18 of the 20 large cities tracked by the S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller index, home prices rose considerably; Phoenix, Seattle, and San Diego led the pack.&nbsp;

While buyers may find more options to choose from in this busy spring market, the homes they want will be starting out in higher price points.&nbsp;

**The writing’s on the wall for homebuyers and refinancers.&nbsp;**

It’s better to pick your poison while you still have the choice. Home prices have been against buyers for a while now, but soon, rates won’t be on their side, either.

&nbsp;We saw rates hit new record lows on 14 separate occasions in 2020, but the game of limbo seems to be over.&nbsp;

Buyers waiting to see if rates will dip back down in the coming months will likely end up getting saddled with regret—and a much higher purchase price.&nbsp;

If you’re serious about buying a home in 2021 and locking in a great rate, you need to know that today presents a better opportunity than tomorrow.&nbsp;
