Friends and Clients —

I want to tell you about a quick and easy way to save hundreds of dollars when you're refinancing or taking out a mortgage.

I'm talking about&nbsp;**a little-known option called an appraisal waiver.**

In a nutshell, when a lender decides to give you a loan, they want to have a good idea of what your property is worth.

The typical way they do this is by sending out an expert to examine the property.

**This appraisal typically costs between $270 and $750.**&nbsp;As you can probably guess, it's you, the borrower, who is on the hook for paying this fee.

The appraisal waiver, on the other hand, is simply&nbsp;**a way to skip this fee.**

Instead of sending an expert to visit your home (or future home) in person, the lender uses some fancy data and calculations to**&nbsp;figure out what your home is worth, without any inspection.**

This has been an option for a long time, but it's&nbsp;**jumped significantly in popularity over the past several months because of the pandemic.**

After all, without an in-person inspection, there's less chance of the virus spreading.

Plus, an appraisal waiver saves you the money, time, and hassle of having an appraisal expert visit (assuming you're refinancing).What's more,**&nbsp;it could even result in a higher appraised value for your home**, which would mean better terms for your new mortgage.

What if the virtual appraisal comes back with a number that's less than you hoped for?

In that case, you can still request an in-person appraisal, or simply deal with another lender. You're not bound in any way.

You can see now why this is such a risk-free and easy way to&nbsp;**shave off a few hundred dollars of fees when refinancing your home**&nbsp;or taking out a new mortgage.

Of course, it helps to have an idea of what your home is currently worth.

If you want to get a good start, take a look at the following home value calculator, which is based on recent Raleigh sales:
