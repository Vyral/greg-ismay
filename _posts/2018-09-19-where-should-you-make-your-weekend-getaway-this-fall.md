We’re taking a bit of a diversion from real estate today to talk about a few of my favorite fall weekend getaways here in the Triangle Area:

**1. Asheville.** This is a fantastic place to see the leaves change colors this fall. Many believe that the weekend of October 27 and 28 is going to be the best dates to do that. I highly recommend staying at Asheville Cottages, a family-owned operation that has a number of private cottages with wonderful amenities and great views of the foliage. **There are plenty of galleries and boutiques to see up in Asheville, as well as delicious restaurants.** My favorite one is Market Place, a wonderful farm-to-table restaurant, but you might want to make a reservation.

**2. Beaufort, NC.** For those of you who love boating, you know this is the boating capital of the Carolinas. **This quaint little town is perfect to walk around in and the Beaufort Inn has some really nice waterfront rooms.** The Cedars Inn is a historic bed-and-breakfast that’s a great place to stay too. There's plenty of seafood dining options, including La Perla, a delicious Spanish restaurant right at The Cedars Inn. There is also Front Street Grill right on the water.

**3. Kinston.** If you're a foodie, you’re probably aware of the fantastic restaurant “The Chef and the Farmer”. You may recognize Vivian Howard from her cooking show on PBS or from her very successful farm-to-table restaurant right here in Kinston. **On October 21, the Howards are hosting a celebration and a viewing of the last episode of their successful show.** If you need a place to stay in Kinston, try The Mother Earth Motor Lodge for an affordable option.
