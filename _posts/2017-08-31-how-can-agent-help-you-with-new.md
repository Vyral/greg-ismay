Why is being a represented buyer so important to the purchase of a new construction home? There are more reasons than you may think.

If you have been considering purchasing a new home, it’s absolutely vital that you hire an agent to represent you.

Even if you are not in the market for a new home at the moment, this information may still be pertinent to you in the future.

As of late, many people have begun to shift the focus of their home search from resale properties to new construction. In the majority of popular price ranges in 2017, in fact, one in every three homes sold is a new construction.

New construction purchases are becoming more and more popular as time goes on.

What does all of this mean in terms of you hiring your own agent?

**First of all, the builder rep, or on-site agent, has a fiduciary responsibility to the seller.** An on-site agent is there with the express purpose of getting the best deal for the seller—they are simply not looking out for your best interests.

Only your own agent will truly work toward getting you the best deal. Nevertheless, one of the primary reasons people tend to believe they should forego representation is cost.

**The cost of hiring an agent, however, is massively inconsequential compared to the money, opportunity, and peace of mind you gain from professional representation** in a real estate transaction. As a matter of fact, the on-site agent, as well, would prefer you have representation.

Working directly with another agent will not only help you but also everyone involved, to achieve as smooth a deal as possible.

Another factor to consider in terms of cost is that add-ons, like fencing, could push the price of the property above what it was listed at. Even though you may be paying a slightly higher price, **working with an agent will still greatly aid you in obtaining the greatest value possible.**

But, financial benefits are not all you gain from being represented. Having an extra set of eyes and ears on the building process will be extremely helpful in making sure that you are protected.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
