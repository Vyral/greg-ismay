If you are preparing your home for the market, you need to check on your crawl space.

You may say, “Why would I even want to think about the crawl space? I don’t want to go look at it. There are spiders down there!”

I completely understand where you are coming from. Like the saying goes: Out of sight, out of mind. However, we’ve had several clients experience delays and costly surprises during their transactions thanks to their crawl space. These issues could have been avoided with some preparation up front.

When you look at your crawl space, there are a few things to watch out for.

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1. The insulation is hanging down.** If you see this, that could mean that moisture levels have risen above the acceptable level. If that’s the case, you should also look for small leaks in any pipes and get those taken care of. Check for water around the foundation as well. It could be that your gutters are clogged, that your downspouts aren’t draining properly, or that you need extensions for your downspouts.

**2. Is your vapor barrier in good condition?** The vapor barrier should not be torn. Make sure that it is spread out evenly and that it covers the majority of the dirt floor in the crawl space.

**3. Termite bond.** If you have a company that checks your property, they will do moisture readings in the crawl space. A lack of moisture helps prevent termites. If you don’t have a termite bond, it might be worth your while to get a termite inspection before you put your home on the market.

These are just a few things you can do to avoid any delays or costly repairs once you get your home on the market and under contract.

If you have any other questions about crawl space maintenance or preparing your home for the market, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
