Whether you’re preparing your home for sale or just settling into a new home, a little painting can go a long way in terms improving that home’s value.

With that in mind, today I’m joined by Roy Taylor of Roy Taylor Painting to demonstrate the impact paint can have on a home. They’ve been in business for five years, and they know all the tricks of the trade. In the video above, you can follow along as we roam through a home that was just worked on.

According to Roy, before you do any painting on the exterior of the home, **you need to look it over and see if the surface is clean enough to paint**. Before Roy’s team even starts a job, they usually pressure-wash everything first. The deck, especially, can get very dirty and be susceptible to mold that can cause rotting wood. As a part of their service, Roy’s team can replace any boards or siding that have sustained damage.

On the inside of your home, **painting is a good, quick, and easy way to modernize the aesthetic of a room such as your kitchen**. As far as that goes, Roy and his crew can customize your colors to match the rest of your decor in your house. As you can see in the video, they painted the cabinets of that home’s kitchen white to match with the grey color of the granite countertop.

I want to extend a special thanks to Roy for joining us and sharing his expertise. We take pride in the vendors that we refer, and Roy Taylor Painting exemplifies the same excellence we expect from ourselves in serving you.
