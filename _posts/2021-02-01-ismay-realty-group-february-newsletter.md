It’s February\!\! We are moving right along in 2021\! Spring is around the corner\!

What will the real estate market look like in 2021? Market experts say the pandemic is a main predictor.

The nation will continue to see COVID-19’s unprecedented seller’s market effect on the single-family housing market, experts say, and it will be evident in North Carolina — particularly in the Triangle and Charlotte.

Since the summer’s housing boom began, sales surpassed those in 2019 due to the Triangle’s existing popularity and to all-time-low federal interest rates, which allow more people to afford mortgages.

In the Triangle, the annual number of housing starts grew by 4.5% in 2020, but the number of homes sold far outpaced that number, growing by 11.4% from last year, according to Metrostudy.

As we see it, the housing market is still on target and homes are selling\!
