If you’re a part of Generation X, **now is a great time to trade up to your dream home for a few reasons.**

The first is that the Baby Boomer generation is starting to sell their homes. They are in their early 50s to 70s and have started downsizing now that their families have grown and gone. This means **there are nearly 80 million people giving up those Generation X dream homes.**

So if you are a part of Generation X, meaning you’re in your early 30s to 50s, and you are looking for a bigger home for your family, there are only 50 million of your generation looking for homes for sale by 80 million Baby Boomers. Based on those numbers, now is a great time to jump in the market.

There is also good new for Generation X sellers as well. There are 75 million members of the millennial generation, whose ages range from early teens to early 30s. **The older members of this group are rumoured to be incredibly active this year in the market, making it a great time to sell your home.**

If you are looking to trade up to a bigger home or if you have any real estate questions, please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
