The holiday season is just around the corner, so today we want to wish you a safe, happy Thanksgiving and invite you to our free pie giveaway on Tuesday, November 20. All you have to do is stop by our office at 4700 Homewood Court any time between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. to pick up your free pie. In the meantime, just RSVP by emailing us at [clientcare@ismayrealtygroup.com](mailto:clientcare@ismayrealtygroup.com) or calling us at (919) 636-5272 and tell us whether you’d like an apple or pumpkin pie and who will be picking up your pie. We appreciate your business, your referrals, and the opportunity to stay in touch with you, and we’re glad to be able to help you celebrate Thanksgiving.
