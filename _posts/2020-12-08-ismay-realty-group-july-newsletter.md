Welcome July\! In some ways, this year is really flying by\!

We hope you and your loved ones are doing well and staying safe in these uncertain times\! It seems everyday there’s something new. We are all handling things in the best way we can.

As I write this newsletter in the middle of June, we are in Phase 2, hoping to move into Phase 3 during July.

With all this uncertainty, how is your world? Are you planning a summer vacation somewhere? Do you think it’s safe to be traveling? Are your favorite restaurants open? Are you a business owner? Have you reopened your business? We hope that things are looking more normal for you and your family.

We would love to hear from you\! Please share what your world is looking like these days\!

Please know that we will be here\! Feel free to reach out with any questions you may have regarding selling your home, looking for a property in the Raleigh area or looking for investment property. We are always happy to guide you (or friends/family)\!

The Ismay Realty Group continues to give a huge Thank You\! to all the essential workers that continue to work so hard to keep us all safe while putting their own lives in harms way. Thank you\! And we hope life is looking a little more normal for them, as well.

Please stay safe and healthy\! We will all continue to get through this together\!
