What kind of smart technology are we seeing in homes these days?

One of the most popular additions is smart thermostats, and one of the major brands we see most often is Nest. This product learns your behavior and habits and adjusts your HVAC system accordingly. If you want it cool at night during the summertime and you forgot to turn the temperature down, it will remember and do it for you. If you leave you home for an extended period of time and forgot to adjust the thermostat, it will automatically recognize the fact that no one’s there and adjust itself.

We also see surveillance technology prevalent in many homes nowadays. This system primarily involves cameras installed in homes as an added protection for when homeowners travel or leave their families for an extended period of time. This equipment allows you to monitor what’s happening on your property from your smartphone.

Moving into the kitchen, there’s a lot of smart culinary technology we’re seeing pop up, such as the no-touch faucet, the smart refrigerator, and a Bluetooth thermometer that syncs to your phone.

With the no-touch faucet, you can activate water pressure by waving your hands in front of the faucet and rinsing them without ever having to touch anything. The smart refrigerator is programmed to remind you when you’re running low on food. The Bluetooth thermometer allows you to monitor your oven temperature without having to open the door.

The last thing I want to talk about is the whole house remote. This technology is pretty self-explanatory. It allows you to adjust audio, video, and lighting in multiple rooms in your house. It’s pretty cool stuff. &nbsp;&nbsp;
