As we approach the end of the year and prepare for 2018, it’s a good time to reflect on the blessings we’ve seen in 2017. I recently learned that when you write down the things you’re grateful for, a chemical reaction occurs in your brain which leads to feelings of joy.

<div class="post-cta">
Selling a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Get a free home value report</a><br>
Buying a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>
</div>

This is a proven fact, so why not give it a try? **If you’d like to let me know what you are grateful for this year, get in touch. I’d love to hear from you.**

Here at the Ismay Realty Group, we’re grateful for a few things. First of all, we’re grateful for our office manager, Robyn. Robyn has been with us a long time, and despite some medical hardships this year, she has been recovering well. She’s still receiving some treatments, but is getting stronger all the time.

The second thing we’re grateful for is all of you: our clients. **We appreciate everyone who has trusted their transaction to us over this past year.**

We’re also thankful for all of the great vendors we work with. We know people who specialize in flooring, paint, tax preparation, and more. So, if you ever need a recommendation, we’ve got you covered.

Another thing we’re grateful for is our area. Between our great real estate and job markets, our amazing quality of life, and our fantastic economy, our team is very happy to live here.

I hope your holiday season is happy and safe. I’ll see you next year.

If you have any real estate questions, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
