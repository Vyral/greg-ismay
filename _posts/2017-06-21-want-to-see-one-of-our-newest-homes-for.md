Today we’re offering you a sneak peek of a beautiful ranch-style property coming on the market this Saturday.

Follow along with me in the video above for a guided tour of the exterior of a gorgeous property we’re putting on the market this Saturday.

This is a custom-built home that was built for the developer of this particular neighborhood who also developed several other high-end neighborhoods in Wake Forest. We’re pricing this home to sell, so there will be a lot of demand for it. **We’ll run open houses for it on both Saturday and Sunday,** and our goal is to have it sold by Monday when the homeowner gets back from their beach trip.

So what does the outside of this single-story, ranch-style home have to offer?

Starting out front, a nice, big driveway circles all the way around the yard and affords a lot of space for parking. Since this home is located on the west side of US 1 in Wake Forest, **this area isn’t as congested with traffic as what you would see on the east side.** The lot this property sits on is well-treed, and the canopy of shade keeps things much cooler on a hot summer day.

As you can see, the current homeowner does his due diligence in terms of landscaping. He selected the home’s exterior color scheme so it would showcase the cedar shake roof, which was redone in 2008 and was recently inspected and serviced. If you’re not familiar with cedar shake roofing, it’s designed to last longer than asphalt shingles.

If you’re looking for single-level living, it’s tough to find a ranch-style home with all of the bedrooms on the same level. In this home, the master bedroom and the study are on one side, and the other bedrooms are on the other.

Rounding out the tour, the back of the home is bulwarked by a very generous deck that spans almost its entire length, and farther out in the backyard lies a scenic pond stocked with fish.

If you or someone you know is interested in this property, come join us this Saturday or Sunday or give us a call so we can schedule a private tour of the inside.
