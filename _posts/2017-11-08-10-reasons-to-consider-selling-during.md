Although spring is traditionally considered the best time to sell a home, today I’m excited to share the top 10 reasons you should consider listing in the next few months before the spring market hits.

Selling a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Get a free home value report</a><br>
Buying a home? <a href="" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>
</div>

**10. You will have the opportunity to be a non-contingent buyer in the spring.** In the spring, there are more homes available on the market. By listing now, you can sell high and buy low in the spring.

**9. You can restrict showings during the holidays.** They don’t have to upset your family time.

**8. January is when employees start new jobs.** Since transfer employees can’t wait until spring to buy, you’ll need to be on the market at the end of the year to capture those buyers.

**7. People are looking to buy for tax reasons.**

**6. People have more time to look for homes.** Because people often take off work during the holidays, they will be freer to spend time searching the market than other times of the year.

**5. Buyers are more emotional.** During the holidays, people become sentimental and may be more likely to pay a higher price.

**4. Houses show better when they are decorated for the holidays.** Everyone loves seasonal decor, so homes at this time of year are more attractive.

**3. Supply will dramatically increase as the spring market ramps up in January.** This will lead to less demand, and less demand means less money in your pocket.

**2. Serious buyers have fewer options.** During fall and winter months, there is less competition on the market. This puts your listing at an advantage.

**1. People who look for homes at this time of year are much more serious about buying.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information about selling your home this time of year, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
