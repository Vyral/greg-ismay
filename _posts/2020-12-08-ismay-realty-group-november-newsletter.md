Here we are in November\! We are looking forward to the holidays. We are focusing on the economy and we feel strongly that the economy is going to bounce back even better than before and is going to flourish. We encourage everyone to focus on the positive. Let’s keep doing our part to support our amazing local businesses.

August 2020 saw Wake County real estate activity remained steady at levels comparable with pre-COVID-19 periods. August's activity was overall consistent with June and July results. &nbsp;Charles P. Gilliam, the Register of Deeds for Wake County commented “we are now seeing a case of ‘no news is good news.’ The real estate market is moving along steadily, appearing unaffected by difficulties severely impacting some sectors.”

During August 2020 core market transactions were $1.0 billion, up 8%, or $78 million, compared to August 2019, but down 7%, or $72 million, compared to July 2020. The core market is defined as property valued at $1 million or less and it comprised about 97% of August’s transactions.
