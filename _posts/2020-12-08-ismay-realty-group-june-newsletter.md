Hello June\!

We hope you and your loved ones are doing well\!

As I write this newsletter in the middle of May, we are about to start on Phase 1 of the re-opening of the state.

How are you feeling about that? Do you consider this a good thing? Do you think it’s time? Do you think schools will open in the fall? We would love to hear your thoughts\!

We are waiting for the restaurants to open (hopefully by the time this reaches you, outdoor seating is available). Waiting for hair salons and other small businesses to be allowed to open and operate. Waiting for life to resume back to some sort of normalcy or start with a new “normal.” I am wondering how many people will continue to work from home.

Please know that we will be here\! Please feel free to reach out with any questions you may have regarding selling your home, looking for a property in the Raleigh area or looking for investment property. We are always happy to guide you (or friends/family)\!

The Ismay Realty Group continues to give a huge Thank You\! to all the essential workers that have been working so hard to keep us all safe while putting their own lives in harms way. Thank you\!

Please stay safe and healthy\! Stay home, if that feels best for you. We all continue to get through this together\!
