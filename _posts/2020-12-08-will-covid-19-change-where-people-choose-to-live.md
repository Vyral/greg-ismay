Friends and Clients —

The coronavirus pandemic is sure to have long-reaching consequences—some of which might surprise you

.For example,&nbsp;**the pandemic might completely overturn recent trends of where people choose to live.**

For the past three decades, people have increasingly preferred cities to suburbs. In fact, according to a recent study, each new generation of young people has been more and more likely to move to cities. Many stayed on in cities, even after getting married and having a family.

Post coronavirus, that may well change.

One obvious reason is health.&nbsp;**Urban areas are more crowded with more inevitable interaction and possible exposure to viruses**.

Another reason is that**&nbsp;shelter-in-place orders can be harder to bear in an urban apartment.**&nbsp;By comparison, a house in the suburbs can offer more space, a backyard, and easier access to areas for biking, jogging, and spending time safely outdoors.

Finally, workplaces are changing.&nbsp;**Many people will continue to work from home after the pandemic passes.&nbsp;**Along with the dropping cost of gas, this makes long commutes a much smaller issue.

Unsurprisingly, a Harris poll performed on April 25 through April 27 found 46% of city dwellers are considering a move. This compares to 26% in the suburbs and 21% in rural areas.

This is not just empty talk. While home sales nearly ground to a halt at the end of March, things are changing.&nbsp;**Demand is coming back up**, with Zillow and Redfin both reporting increased search traffic and buyer inquiries. Around Raleigh, I can definitely vouch for increased activity.

Of course, the pandemic is still ongoing. I hope this information will be useful in case you were thinking of buying or selling a home before the pandemic arrived—or now that it's here.
