Welcome September\!

The days are getting shorter and hopefully that means cooler weather and lower humidity\!&nbsp; We hope you and yours are adjusting to some of the new norms and are able to remain productive, active and healthy.&nbsp;

Personally, I have found new ways to stay active while the gym remains closed and am enjoying the variety.&nbsp; By the time you read this I will be in the process (or have completed) a two-day hike up Mt. Whitney with three buddies.&nbsp; We are grateful that we have been healthy and able to train as well travel and honor the commitments we’ve made to reach the summit\!

Meanwhile, the housing market still continues to do well. According to Triangle Multiple Listing Services data, there were nearly 9,000 homes for sale in June 2019; in June 2020, there were fewer than 5,800 homes listed. While new listings are down 6.3% year-to-date, closed sales are up 0.8%, highlighting the competitiveness of the market and the determination of buyers and sellers to adapt and get things done\!&nbsp; I love that about this country\!

If you or family/friends are looking to explore what Raleigh and the surrounding areas have to offer, please reach out. We are here to answer questions and keep you informed of what is happening in the area.

We hope you and your loved ones are doing well. We would love to hear from you\! As always please feel free to let us know how you’re doing. Please stay positive, safe and healthy\!

We will continue to get through this together\!
